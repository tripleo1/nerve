Jenkins is a leading open source automation server built with Java that monitors executions of repeated jobs, such as building a software project or jobs run by cron. With Jenkins, organizations can accelerate the software development process through automation. It manages and controls development life-cycle processes of all kinds, including build, document, test, package, stage, deployment, static analysis and many more.</description></item></channel></rss>
