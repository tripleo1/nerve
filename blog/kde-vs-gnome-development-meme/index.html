whether the GNOME or KDE desktop is &ldquo;best&rdquo;. I have an opinion on that, but
that&rsquo;s not what this is about. This is about how I picture the development
process of each of those fine desktop products.</p><p>Warning to readers: this is mildly offensive, however it&rsquo;s not particularly
obscene, for most values of obscene. On a flame-o-riffic scale of one to ten, it
rates about a seventy-three.</p><p>When I contemplate how the GNOME and KDE desktops are developed, here is what I
imagine:</p><hr><h1 id=kde>KDE</h1><p>A big room somewhere in Europe with lots of chrome and glass and a great big
whiteboard in the front with lots of tiny, neat writing on it. There are about
50 desks, each with headphones and pristine workstations, also with a lot of
chrome and glass. The faint sound of classical music permeates the room,
accompanying the clicky-click of 50 programmers typing or quietly talking in one
of the appropriately assigned meeting areas. (Which of course consist of elegant
contemporary white pine coffee tables surrounded by contemporary white pine and
fine leather meeting chairs.) Coffee, tea, mineral water and fruit juices are
available in the break area.</p><p>At the end of the day, <em>everyone</em> checks in their code and the project leader
does a &ldquo;make&rdquo; just to make sure it all compiles cleanly, but it&rsquo;s mostly only
done from tradition anymore since it always compiles cleanly and works
flawlessly. When all milestones have been met, and everything has been QA&rsquo;d,
(usually within a day or two of the roadmap that was written up 18 months
previous) a new KDE release is packaged up and released to the mirror sites with
the appropriate 24-hour delay for distribution before being announced.</p><p>KDE developers are generally between the ages of 16 and 25, like art made of
lines and squares and the colors white and black. When/if they finally stop
taking government subsidies and get around to getting &ldquo;real jobs,&rdquo; most of their
salary will be taken in taxes so the socialist government can subsidize the care
and feeding of the next generation of KDE developers, just like it did for them.
A high percentage of KDE developers, during their mandatory 5 years of
government military service, crack from their years of cultural dullness and
flee Europe to become terrorists for the sheer joy to be found in killing random
strangers for no discernible reason.</p><h1 id=gnome>GNOME</h1><p>An abandoned warehouse in San Francisco, kitted up as for a rave, electronica
playing at 15db louder than &ldquo;my ears are bleeding and I&rsquo;m developing an
aneurism&rdquo; volumes and the windows all painted over black so that the strobe and
spotlights and lasers can be seen better. Computers, mainly made of whatever
stuff has been exchanged for crack or scavenged from dumpsters behind dot-bombs,
are scattered around on whatever furniture is available, which also consists of
whatever stuff has been exchanged for crack or scavenged from dumpsters behind
dot-bombs. There&rsquo;s no break area, but you may be able to bum a beer (or more
likely something harder) off of one of the developers hanging around, and they
will probably be too jacked up on X, coke, acid, heroin, ether or all of the
above to notice that you&rsquo;ve taken anything.</p><p>Development strategies are generally determined by whatever light show happens
to be going on at the moment, when one of the developers will leap up and scream
&ldquo;I WANT IT TO LOOK JUST LIKE THAT&rdquo; and then straight-arm his laptop against the
wall in an hallucinogenic frenzy before vomiting copiously, passing out and
falling face-down in the middle of the dance floor. There&rsquo;s no whiteboard, so
developers diagram things out in the puddles of spilt beer, urine and vomit on
the floor.</p><p>At the end of the day - whenever that is since an equal number of programmers
will be passed out at any given time - or really whenever someone happens to
think of it (which is rarely), someone might type &ldquo;make&rdquo; on some machine
somewhere, with mixed results. Generally nothing happens, so he/she shrugs
his/her shoulders and wanders off to look for someone who might have more
pink/black-striped pills. Once in a great while, generally in the unpleasant
time between the come-down from the last thing they took and before whatever it
was they took just now comes on fully, someone will tar up a bunch of random
files and post it on a website someplace it as the next GNOME release, usually
with a reference to some kind of monkey.</p><p>GNOME developers rarely live past 25 and prefer &ldquo;alternative&rdquo; art - generally
stuff made of feces that&rsquo;s &ldquo;too edgy&rdquo; for most people to &ldquo;understand&rdquo; or &ldquo;like.&rdquo;
Core GNOME developers are heavy Ketamine users. The bodies of GNOME developers
can often be found in dumpsters or floating face-down in any sufficiently large
body of water.</p><hr><p>Copyright 2002, Derek Glidden.</p><br><p class=back-to-posts><a href=https://tripleo1.github.io/blog>Back to posts</a></p></div><br><div class=disqus></div></div></div></section><script src=https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/highlight.js/9.11.0/highlight.min.js></script>
